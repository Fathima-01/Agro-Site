Overview:
The Farm-to-Market Connection Platform is an intuitive and user-friendly GUI designed to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers in the agricultural community. This platform serves as a virtual marketplace where farmers can showcase their produce, and buyers can directly connect with them to make purchases.

Different options help buyers find specific products of farmers according to interest.
Buyers can easily communicate with farmers, inquire about products, and place orders directly.
Direct Connection: The platform eliminates intermediaries, allowing farmers and buyers to establish direct relationships, leading to better pricing and increased profits for farmers.
